# SOC Allowlisting Guide — Arachnid Core

**Audience:** the SOC, detection engineering, or EDR administration team being
asked to allow this binary to run on managed endpoints.

Arachnid Core is a DFIR triage tool. It runs with high privilege on hosts that
may be actively compromised, and it does things that look like reconnaissance —
enumerating processes, reading persistence locations, capturing packets. That
resemblance is real, and the honest answer to it is disclosure, not evasion.

This document tells you exactly what the binary touches so you can write a
narrow allow rule instead of a broad one. Nothing here is marketing: if a
behaviour is not on this page, it is a bug, and we want the report.
